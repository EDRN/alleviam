Welcome to "Alleviam", the EDRN cancer informatics alleviation and monitoring
system.  Alleviam keeps tabs on essential informatics services, warns
administrators when things are not copasetic, and where possible tries to
automatically remedy the situation by restarting processes, sending process
signals, and so forth.

This is the Alleviam buildout for the host cancer.jpl.nasa.gov.  This host is
the *master* Alleviam server.  See the docs/INSTALL.txt file for more on what
that actually means.  Installation on other hosts is not required at this
time (that is, all monitoring happens from cancer.jpl.nasa.gov).

This configuration, documentation, and software was developed by the
`Informatics Center`_ for the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN_), which
is located at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL_), operated by the California
Institute of Technology (Caltech_).  This is copyrighted and licensed
material; please see the docs/LICENSE.txt file for more details.

You can find installation instructions in the docs/INSTALL.txt file.

The latest changes are available in the docs/HISTORY.txt file.
